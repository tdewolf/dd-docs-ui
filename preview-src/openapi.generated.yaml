      summary: Create User
      description: |
        Invites a new user under the organization.

        After making a REST API request, an invitation email is triggered and sent to the user. Upon receiving the invitation email, the user is required to click on a provided URL, which will redirect them to a page with a user interface (UI) where they can set their username and password.

        The modification of any personal information related to a user can only be performed by the user through the UI. Similarly, the user can solely conduct password updates through the UI.

        The "caller" possessing Organization Owner access rights retains the exclusive user creation capability. They hold the authority to assign roles at the organisation and project levels.

        At present, our support is limited to the resourceType of "project" exclusively.

        In order to access this endpoint, the provided API key must have the role referenced below :
        - Organization Owner

      summary: List Users
      description: |
        Lists all the users in the organization and filter on the basis of projectId.

        In order to access this endpoint, the provided API key must have at least one of the roles referenced below :
        - Organization Owner
        - Organization Member
        - Project Creator

        The results are always limited by the role and scope of the caller’s privileges.

        When retrieving a list of users through a GET request, if a user holds the organization owner role, the response will exclude project-level permissions for those users. This is because organization owners have full access to all resources within the organization, making project-level permissions irrelevant for them.

        For SortBy query params, we only support id, name and email.

        To learn more about the roles, see our docs [here](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/organizations/organization-user-roles.html) and [here](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/projects/project-roles.html).

      summary: Get User
      description: |
        Fetches the details of given user.

        In order to access this endpoint, the provided API key must have at least one of the roles referenced below :
        - Organization Owner
        - Organization Member
        - Project Creator

        The results are always limited by the role and scope of the caller’s privileges.

        When performing a GET request for a user with an organization owner role, the response will exclude project-level permissions for that user. This is because organization owners have access to all resources at the organization level, rendering project-level permissions unnecessary for them

        To learn more about the roles, see our docs [here](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/organizations/organization-user-roles.html) and [here](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/projects/project-roles.html).

      summary: Update User
      description: |
        Updates organizationRole and resources of the user.

        In order to access this endpoint, the provided API key must have at least one of the roles referenced below :
        - Organization Owner
        - Project Owner

        An "Organization Owner" API key can be utilized to update organizational-level roles and project-level roles for all projects within the organization.

        The "Project Owner" API key allows for updating project-level roles, solely within the projects where the API key holds the "Project Owner" role.

        The modification of any personal information related to a user, like password updates, can only be performed by the respective user themselves through the user interface (UI).

        The results are always limited by the role and scope of the caller’s privileges.
        To learn more about the roles, see our docs [here](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/organizations/organization-user-roles.html) and [here](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/projects/project-roles.html).

    description: Couchbase Capella uses an ordered hierarchy to help you keep all of your data organized and securely accessible. The entity at the top of the hierarchy is called an organization. Everything you do in Capella - whether it’s creating a cluster or managing billing - happens within the scope of an organization.
  - name: certificates
    description: 'Couchbase Server supports the use of x.509 certificates, for clients and servers. This ensures that- Only approved users, applications, machines, and endpoints have access to system resources. Consequently, the mechanism can be used by Couchbase SDK clients, to access Couchbase Services; and by source clusters that use XDCR to replicate data to target clusters. Clients can verify the identity of Couchbase Server, thereby ensuring that they are not exchanging data with a rogue entity.'
  - name: backups & restore (WIP)
    description: Couchbase supports a robust scheduled backup and retention time policy as part of an overall disaster recovery plan for production data. Couchbase Capella supports scheduled and on-demand backups of bucket data. A backup can be restored to the same database where it was created or another database in the same organization. An on-demand backup of a bucket is always a Full backup. Capella schedules on-demand backup to start immediately.

Couchbase Capella supports scheduled and on-demand backups of bucket data. A backup can be restored to the same database where it was created or another database in the same organization. On setting up a backup schedule, the bucket automatically backs up the bucket based on the chosen schedule.'
